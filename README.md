The Supermarket Queue Kata
=
There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

So, for example:

```text
queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
// should return 12
// because when n=1, the total time is just the sum of the times

queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
// should return 10
// because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the 
// queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
// should return 12
```
